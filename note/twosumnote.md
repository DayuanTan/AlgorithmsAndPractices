# use hashtable

- Time complexity O(n)
- Space complexity O(n)

# use sort + 2 pointers


- Time complexity O(nlogn)
- Space complexity O(1) 

Note space complexity means the extra needed space, excluding input and output.

# follow up 1

- If it is sorted, which is better?
  - 2 pointers > hashtable

# follow up 2
- If ask you return the indices of the two found elements, which is better?
  - hashtable > 2 pointers
