302. Smallest Rectangle Enclosing Black Pixels

困难

https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/smallest-rectangle-enclosing-black-pixels/


You are given an m x n binary matrix image where 0 represents a white pixel and 1 represents a black pixel.

The black pixels are connected (i.e., there is only one black region). Pixels are connected horizontally and vertically.

Given two integers x and y that represents the location of one of the black pixels, return the area of the smallest (axis-aligned) rectangle that encloses all black pixels.

You must write an algorithm with less than O(mn) runtime complexity

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/pixel-grid.jpg)
```
Input: image = [["0","0","1","0"],["0","1","1","0"],["0","1","0","0"]], x = 0, y = 2
Output: 6
```

Example 2:
```
Input: image = [["1"]], x = 0, y = 0
Output: 1
``` 

Constraints:
```
m == image.length
n == image[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 100
image[i][j] is either '0' or '1'.
0 <= x < m
0 <= y < n
image[x][y] == '1'.
The black pixels in the image only form one component.
```
