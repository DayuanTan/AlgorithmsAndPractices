212. Word Search II


困难

https://leetcode.cn/problems/word-search-ii/


Given an m x n board of characters and a list of strings words, return all words on the board.

Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where adjacent cells are horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

 

Example 1:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/07/search1.jpg)

```
Input: board = [["o","a","a","n"],["e","t","a","e"],["i","h","k","r"],["i","f","l","v"]], words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
Output: ["eat","oath"]
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/07/search2.jpg)

```
Input: board = [["a","b"],["c","d"]], words = ["abcb"]
Output: []
``` 

Constraints:
```
m == board.length
n == board[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 12
board[i][j] is a lowercase English letter.
1 <= words.length <= 3 * 104
1 <= words[i].length <= 10
words[i] consists of lowercase English letters.
All the strings of words are unique.
```

隐藏提示1
- You would need to optimize your backtracking to pass the larger test. Could you stop backtracking earlier?


隐藏提示2
- If the current candidate does not exist in all words' prefix, you could stop backtracking immediately. What kind of data structure could answer such query efficiently? Does a hash table work? Why or why not? How about a Trie? If you would like to learn how to implement a basic trie, please work on this problem: Implement Trie (Prefix Tree) first.

# think 使用哪种搜索策略

A: for 词典里的每个单词 { check 单词是否在矩阵里 } (sol 1)

B: for 矩阵的每个单词 { check 单词是否在词典里} (sol 2)
