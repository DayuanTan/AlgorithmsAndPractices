323. Number of Connected Components in an Undirected Graph

中等

https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/number-of-connected-components-in-an-undirected-graph/


You have a graph of n nodes. You are given an integer n and an array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between ai and bi in the graph.

Return the number of connected components in the graph.

 


Example 1:

```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 2
```

Example 2:

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/14/conn2-graph.jpg)

```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: 1
``` 

Constraints:
```
1 <= n <= 2000
1 <= edges.length <= 5000
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= ai <= bi < n
ai != bi
There are no repeated edges.
```
