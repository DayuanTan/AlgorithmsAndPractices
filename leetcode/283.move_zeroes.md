283. Move Zeroes
难度
简单

https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/move-zeroes/

Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
 

Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 104
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
```

## Follow up: Could you minimize the total number of operations done?

## 提示1
In-place means we should not be allocating any space for extra array. But we are allowed to modify the existing array. However, as a first step, try coming up with a solution that makes use of additional space. For this problem as well, first apply the idea discussed using an additional array and the in-place solution will pop up eventually.
## 提示2
A two-pointer approach could be helpful here. The idea would be to have one pointer for iterating the array and another pointer that just works on the non-zero elements of the array.


# 2 ways to ask
## if don't need to maintain the relative order of non-zero elements in original array
- Best solution: partition
## if need to maintain the relative order of non-zero elements in original array (This question)
- Best solution: fast & slow 2 pointers 

# Not that good solution. O(n) but more write operations. Easier to understand.

python
```py
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        if not nums:
            return
        
        slow, fast = 0, 0
        while fast <= len(nums) - 1:
            if nums[fast] != 0:
                nums[slow], nums[fast] = nums[fast], nums[slow]
                slow += 1
            fast += 1
```

# Better solution. O(n) guarantee least write operation

```py
class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        if not nums:
            return
        
        slow, fast = 0, 0
        while fast <= len(nums) - 1:
            if nums[fast] != 0:
                nums[slow] = nums[fast] 
                slow += 1
            fast += 1
            
        while slow < len(nums):
            if nums[slow] != 0:
                nums[slow] = 0
            slow += 1

```
