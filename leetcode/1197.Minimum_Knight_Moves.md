1197. Minimum Knight Moves

中等
https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/minimum-knight-moves/

In an infinite chess board with coordinates from -infinity to +infinity, you have a knight at square [0, 0].

A knight has 8 possible moves it can make, as illustrated below. Each move is two squares in a cardinal direction, then one square in an orthogonal direction.

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/12/knight.png)

Return the minimum number of steps needed to move the knight to the square [x, y]. It is guaranteed the answer exists.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: x = 2, y = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1]

Example 2:

Input: x = 5, y = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: [0, 0] → [2, 1] → [4, 2] → [3, 4] → [5, 5]
``` 

Constraints:
```
-300 <= x, y <= 300
0 <= |x| + |y| <= 300
```

隐藏提示1
- You can simulate the movements since the limits are low.

隐藏提示2
- Is there a search algorithm applicable to this problem?

隐藏提示3
- Since we want the minimum number of moves, we can use Breadth First Search.
