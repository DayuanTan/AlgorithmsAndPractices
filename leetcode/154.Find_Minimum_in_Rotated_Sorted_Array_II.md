154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II

困难

https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array-ii/


Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become:
```
[4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.

Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
```
Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain **duplicates**, return the minimum element of this array.

You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,5]
Output: 1

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
``` 

Constraints:
```
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 5000
-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.
``` 

- Follow up: This problem is similar to Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array, but nums may contain duplicates. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?

# solution

## hard point. worst case: Only one O in many 1.

[1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1.... 1 1 0 1 1 ....] 

[3 3 1 3]

[3 3 1]

## Most case O(logn). Worst case O(n)

```py
class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if not nums:
            return -1

        start, end = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while start + 1 < end:
            splitvalue = nums[end] # put target value inside loop
            mid = start + (end - start) // 2
            if nums[mid] < splitvalue:
                end = mid
            elif nums[mid] > splitvalue:
                start = mid
            elif nums[mid] == splitvalue:# cannot decide left or right half part. Only can move left 1 element
                end -= 1

        return min(nums[start], nums[end])
```
