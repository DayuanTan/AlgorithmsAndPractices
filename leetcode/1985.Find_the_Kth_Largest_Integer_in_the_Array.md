(Same as 215 Kth Largest Element in an Array)

https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/find-the-kth-largest-integer-in-the-array/


You are given an array of strings nums and an integer k. Each string in nums represents an integer without leading zeros.

Return the string that represents the kth largest integer in nums.

Note: Duplicate numbers should be counted distinctly. For example, if nums is ["1","2","2"], "2" is the first largest integer, "2" is the second-largest integer, and "1" is the third-largest integer.

 
```
Example 1:

Input: nums = ["3","6","7","10"], k = 4
Output: "3"
Explanation:
The numbers in nums sorted in non-decreasing order are ["3","6","7","10"].
The 4th largest integer in nums is "3".

Example 2:

Input: nums = ["2","21","12","1"], k = 3
Output: "2"
Explanation:
The numbers in nums sorted in non-decreasing order are ["1","2","12","21"].
The 3rd largest integer in nums is "2".

Example 3:

Input: nums = ["0","0"], k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation:
The numbers in nums sorted in non-decreasing order are ["0","0"].
The 2nd largest integer in nums is "0".
 

Constraints:

1 <= k <= nums.length <= 104
1 <= nums[i].length <= 100
nums[i] consists of only digits.
nums[i] will not have any leading zeros.
```

隐藏提示1
If two numbers have different lengths, which one will be larger?

隐藏提示2
The longer number is the larger number.

隐藏提示3
If two numbers have the same length, which one will be larger?

隐藏提示4
Compare the two numbers starting from the most significant digit. Once you have found the first digit that differs, the one with the larger digit is the larger number.
