126. Word Ladder II

困难


https://leetcode.cn/problems/word-ladder-ii/



A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:
```
Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.

Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.

sk == endWord
```


Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return all the shortest transformation sequences from beginWord to endWord, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each sequence should be returned as a list of the words [beginWord, s1, s2, ..., sk].

 
```
Example 1:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output: [["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]]

Explanation: There are 2 shortest transformation sequences:
"hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog"
"hit" -> "hot" -> "lot" -> "log" -> "cog"

Example 2:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: []

Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.
``` 

Constraints:
```
1 <= beginWord.length <= 5
endWord.length == beginWord.length
1 <= wordList.length <= 1000
wordList[i].length == beginWord.length
beginWord, endWord, and wordList[i] consist of lowercase English letters.
beginWord != endWord
All the words in wordList are unique.
```

# idea

1. shortest path -> BFS
2. what to store in queue?
   - node? 
   - path? 
   - if only node you don't know path.
   - so we need to store path. E.g. the queue elements are paths: A, AB, ABC, ABCD 如果使用 BFS 找所有的路径，那么队列里放的就是路径

![](../note/126.png)

## Issues if only use BFS/DFS

many unuseful discovery!

For example:
- If only BFS, in previous example, we will visit "AB" "AC" because they are same distant to starting point. But "AC" is useless.
- If only DFS, in below example, we will visit "ABDEI"  and "ACI" while "ABDEI" is useless. 

![](../note/126-2.png)

How can we know we should visit "C" instead of "B" in above image? 
- We need to know the distance between each node and ending point.

## Best solution: 最优算法: BFS + DFS

- BFS: 求出所有点到终点的距离 
- DFS: 沿着离终点越来越近的路线找到所有路径
